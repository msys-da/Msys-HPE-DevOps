A. Nothing, there are no single points of failure in this architecture.
B. Create and attach a second IGW to provide redundant internet connectivity.
C. Create and configure a second Elastic Load Balancer to provide a redundant load balancer.
D. Create a second multi-AZ RDS instance in another Availability Zone and configurereplication to provide a redundant database.

ans:c

A. Each subnet maps to a single Availability Zone
B. A CIDR block mask of /25 is the smallest range supported
C. Instances in a private subnet can communicate with the internet only if they have an Elastic IP.
D. By default, all subnets can route between each other, whether they are private or public
E. V Each subnet spans at least 2 Availability zones to provide a high-availability environment

Beginner Level Jenkins Interview Questions



1. What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source free automation tool used to build and test software projects. The tool makes it painless for developers to integrate changes to the project. Jenkins' primary focus is to keep track of the version control system and initiate and monitor a build system if there are any changes. It keeps an eye on the entire process and provides reports and notifications to alert.

Some typical reasons as to why Jenkins is so widely used are:

Developers and testers use Jenkins to detect defects in the software development lifecycle and automate the testing of builds. They use it to continuously monitor the code in real-time and integrate changes into the build.Jenkins as it turns out, is a great fit for building a CI/CD pipeline because of its plugin-capabilities, and simple-to-use nature.

2. What are the features of Jenkins?
Some of the crucial features of Jenkins are the following:

1.It is a free and open-source automation tool
2.Jenkins provides a vast number of plugins
3.It is easy to set up and install on multiple operating systems
4.Provides pipeline support
5.Fast release cycles 
6.Easy upgrades


3. What is Groovy in Jenkins?

Apache Groovy is a dynamic object-oriented programming language used as a scripting language for Java platforms. Groovy is used to orchestrate the Jenkins pipeline and enables different teams to contribute to the work in different languages. Groovy's syntax is very similar to that of Java, making it more seamless with the Java interface. The language has several features like Java compatibility and Development support.


4. How do you install Jenkins?
Follow the steps mentioned below to install Jenkins:

Install Java 
Install Apache Tomcat Server
Download Jenkins war File
Deploy Jenkins war File


5. Which commands can be used to begin Jenkins?


Open the command prompt
After the command prompt opens, browse to the directory where Jenkins war is present
Then run the following command:
D:\>Java -jar Jenkins.war

6.What is "Continuous Integration" with reference to Jenkins?

ans: Continuous Integration is a development practice where the codes can be integrated into a shared repository. The practice uses automated verifications for the early detection of code problems. Continuous Integrationtriggers the build to find and identify bugs present in the code.It adds consistency to the build process.Itâ€™s a means to build things faster and prevents broken code.


7.What is a CI/CD pipeline?
 
ans: CI/CD Pipeline or Continuous Integration/ Continuous Delivery is considered the DevOps approach's backbone. The pipeline is responsible for building codes, running tests, and deploying new software versions.

8.What is a Jenkins pipeline?
ans:

   1.The pipeline represents the continuous delivery and continuous integration of all the jobs in the SDLC and DevOps life cycle. 
    2.The Jenkins pipeline is a set of plugins that support implementation and integration of continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins. It connects this pipeline in a particular format by Jenkins.
     3.The Jenkins pipeline solves several problems like the maintenance of thousands of jobs and maintaining deployment with needing to resort to other powerful methods.


9.Name the three different types of pipelines in Jenkins?

Ans:

The three different types of Jenkins pipelines are:

    1.CI/CD pipeline 
    2.Scripted pipeline
    3.Declarative pipeline


10. What are the requirements for using Jenkins?


To use Jenkins, you require the following:

  1.A source code repository that can be accessed, for example, a Git repository.
  2.A build script, for example, a Maven script.
